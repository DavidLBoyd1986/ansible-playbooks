# This gets the Jenkins Master setup

# Will add more later to get the Jenkins Master configured with xml files

# Add in adding a cert using let's encrypt
  # Adding a cert for a private server is stupid and not something that is done outside organizations
  # Might add a self signed cert, and set up trusting it someway, but that's outside the scope of this playbook

# configure DNS for Jenkins
  # I manually configured it on pfsense
  # Might set up a playbook for configuring DNS Entries in pfsense
