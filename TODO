1. Fix SSH Key and how to use ansible user, while logged in as regular user

    - It's not the ansible SSH key. From controller, I can su 'ansible' and ssh without a password
    - It is solely because I am running the playbooks as dboyd
    
2. add 'sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin ansible' to bootstrap_controller.yml

    - name: Set shell for ansible user
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: ansible
        shell: /usr/sbin/nologin

2. Remove 'PermitRootLogin yes' when configuring the Hosts

2. test configuring controller from scratch
